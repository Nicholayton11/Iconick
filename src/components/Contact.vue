            <!-- <h1 class="text-h4 font-weight-bold"> About Me </h1>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> Hi, I’m Nicholas Layton, a Senior Product Manager with over six years of experience turning SaaS product ideas into market successes in both B2B and B2C settings. I love leading teams and working with diverse groups, from large multinationals to energetic startups.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> At KultraLab, I’ve managed the development of an AI Coaching and Behavioral Change app. Working closely with the CEO, we secured £3 million in funding. I streamlined our release process, cutting delivery times from months to weeks, and made sure we always used user feedback to guide our decisions. I also led AI projects with the University of Manchester, integrating machine learning into our product.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light" >Before KultraLab, I was at BT: Data and AI, where I launched a secure B2C document storage app and developed data storage solutions, securing £70 million in funding. I also founded a Climate Change and Sustainability Guild, bringing together 150 members passionate about environmental initiatives.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> Starting out as a Software Developer at BT: GES, I built web-based tools and secure applications, earning the BT Excellency in Programming Award. I also created training sessions for new graduates to help them succeed.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> I hold a Master’s in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology from the University of Manchester and a BSc in Biology from the University of Lincoln. I’ve also completed a course in Business and Climate Change from the University of Cambridge and am a Certified Product Owner through SCRUM Alliance.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> I’m driven by a passion for combining technical know-how with a user-centric approach. I prioritize impactful results and love learning new things. Collaborating with cross-functional teams and championing sustainability are core to who I am as a product manager.</h1>
            <br>
            <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> When i'm not working i'm spending time at home, my wife and I are rennovating our home - perhaps the ultimate test of project managment - and you'll often find me at Old Trafford watching United or out on a run.</h1> -->
