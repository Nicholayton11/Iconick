        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-bold">Background</h1>
        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light"> At BT and EE we recognise that managing paperwork is difficult, research on our customers has found that managing physical documents digitally is of interest to ~80% of older (50+) users. With DataLocker we created a Mobile Application that allows users to manage, set relevant reminders and read all types of documents, from passports to mortgage agreements.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-bold">Implimentation</h1>
        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light">I joined the team working with another Product Manager on the integration of AI to assess and categorise documents. I managed the testing of DataLocker on a large cohort to gain feedback and align it with our future roadmap. I took the AWS based application through a variety of iterations and roadmapped future development including Identify Verification, Gmail Integration and DVLA integration. </h1>
