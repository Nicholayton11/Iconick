        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-bold">Background</h1>
        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light">The UKs high streets are under immense pressure, retail managers can often be the difference between success and failure of a store. However, retail managers are being missed out when it comes to vital training and coaching. At KultraLab we have uncovered what it means to be a high performer and we've distilled these behaviours into an AI Coaching Application. Retail Managers finally have the opportunity to reach their full potential and help their stores excel.</h1>

        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-bold">Implimentation</h1>
        <h1 class="text-h5 font-weight-light">I have managed the delivery of the Kultra App since its release. Working closely with Academic Partners I have enabled a Digital Coaching engine and embedded generative AI into the Mobile Application. As the sole Product Manager I have built up the Product function at KultraLab, focusing on data-lead development, user-feedback and rapid iterations of the Kultra App. Iâ€™ve also developed the Product and Content Strategy of the product ensuring that the user experience is clear, easy to follow and effective.</h1>
